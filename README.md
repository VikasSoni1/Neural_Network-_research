# Neural_Network-_research

This repository will contain all the applications for deep learning in computer vision and reinforcement learning that i come across.


Additionally, it will contain scripts for training neural networks for different applications using libraries like MM-Lab or hugging face.

Also, what is computer vision capable of right now will be discussed? 

We will discuss all the methods that are available and what kind of models we can train according to the newest research.

To do : Add a module for implementing differentiable image processing methods and testing them.
