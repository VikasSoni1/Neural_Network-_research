We will be using libraries like huggingface and mmlab for building training and inference scripts for various models on a custom dataset.

For object detector or instance segmentor, we need to store the annotations in COCO format and these annotations can directly be used with detectron or mmlab libraries.

For semantic segmentation, 
To do : Image to text models.
